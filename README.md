# collision-avoidance
* Simple pytorch classifier for collision avoidance
* You can use a pretrained model (based on [Obstacle Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrushankanand/obstacle-detection/)) or train one with your own data

## Quick Start:
1. (If training on your own data) Collect folders with images of obstacles (label: blocked) and images without obstacles (label: unblocked)
2. Collect folder with images for inference
3. Run ```demo.py``` and follow prompts
